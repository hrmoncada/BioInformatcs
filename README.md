# TRIMOMMATICS
Trimmomatic is a lightweight and multithreaded command line java tool application that can be used to trim and crop Illumina FASTQ data as well as to remove Illumina adapter sequences and low quality reads.  It can be used to performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina paired-end and single end mode.

It works with FASTQ files (using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores, depending on the Illumina pipeline used). Files compressed such as gzip or bzip2 are supported, and are identified by use of .gz or .bz2 file extensions.

# HTCondor 
HTCondor is an open source job scheduler system develop by the University of Wisconsin that specialized in workload management for compute-intensive that supports High Throughput Computing (HTC).  HTCondor provides a set of submission file commands that allow jobs to be submitted through various operating systems such as Linux, Unix, Mac OS, and Windows. It can be download. The following is a Bioinformatic project to speed up BLAST performance using HTcondor scheduler system. The project uses the following server computers to set up the pool computer available.
